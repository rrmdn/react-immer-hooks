## react-immer-hooks

Simple state management based on React Context and React Hooks.

1. Define the state.
2. Define actions that will modify the state (it uses immer, so mutate it all you want).
3. Use the hooks to access the state and actions.

See src/index.spec.tsx on how to use it.

Still in development mode, use with care.
