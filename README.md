## react-immersive

Simple state management for react on top of immer

1. Define the state.
2. Define actions that will modify the state (it uses immer, so mutate it all you want).
3. Use the hooks to access the state and actions.

See src/index.spec.tsx on how to use it.

Still in development mode, use with care.
